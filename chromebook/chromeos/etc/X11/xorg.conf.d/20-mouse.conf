    # Map mouse vertical scroll wheel to buttons 8 and 9.
    # These scroll button events are only used for mice and processed slightly
    # differently in Chrome than buttons 4 and 5, which are used for trackpad
    # scrolling.
    # Unfortunately, this disables mouse wheel scrolling in the crosh shell.

    # 3-Button Mouse emulation, while useful for copy/paste, causes mouse
    # clicks to miss their targets when the mouse is moving quickly.

    # Some mice expose Absolute axes, which take precedence over relative,
    # which causes all axes valuator labels to be absolute. E.g., we get
    # ABS_X instead of REL_X for horizontal movement. This is especially
    # bad for scroll wheel activity, b/c Chrome looks for specific
    # relative valuators for that; if absolute valuators are used, scroll
    # wheel won't work.
